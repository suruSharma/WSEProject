We had originally uploaded the project on linserv machines. In order to keep all the news links latest, we had a crawler that ran every three hours to gather latest news links. This was achieved using an object of the Timer class. But, we were informed by the CIMS support system that the NYU server does not have sufficient resources to run such a Java process. Hence, we had to present our project to the professor as a demo on our local servers. This was done on 4th May after we submitted the project.

In this resubmission we have only updated the README file.
